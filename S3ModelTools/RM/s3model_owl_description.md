# S3Model Ontology Description

## Overview

This OWL (Web Ontology Language) file defines the **S3Model ontology** - a comprehensive framework for creating **Shareable, Structured, Semantic Models**. Developed by Timothy W. Cook (Copyright 2016-2025), S3Model provides a three-layer architecture for modeling, constraining, and validating domain-specific data with sophisticated exception handling.

## Core Architecture

S3Model implements a **three-layer modeling architecture** that separates concerns between abstract models, constrained implementations, and actual data instances:

### Layer 1: Reference Model (RM)
- **Reference Model (RM)**: The foundational layer containing core structural components for a domain
- **Core Model Component (CMC)**: Basic building blocks that define fundamental data structures and relationships
- **Core Model Symbol (CMS)**: Symbolic representations of CMCs in data instances (typically substituted by RMS in practice)

### Layer 2: Data Model (DM) 
- **Data Model (DM)**: Specialized models that constrain Reference Models for specific use cases
- **Restricted Model Component (RMC)**: CMCs that have been constrained and specialized for use in Data Models
- **Restricted Model Symbol (RMS)**: Symbolic representations of RMCs in actual data instances

### Layer 3: Data Instance
- **DataInstance**: Actual data that claims conformance to a Data Model
- **DataInstanceValid**: Data that passes all validation rules according to its Data Model
- **DataInstanceInvalid**: Data with validation issues but includes documented exceptions explaining the problems
- **DataInstanceError**: Data that fails validation without proper exception documentation (should be discarded)

## Key Relationships

The ontology defines critical relationships between components:

- **constrainsRM**: Data Models constrain exactly one Reference Model (functional property)
- **containsCMC**: Reference Models contain multiple Core Model Components
- **containsRMC**: Data Models contain multiple Restricted Model Components  
- **constrainsCMC**: Restricted Model Components constrain Core Model Components
- **isInstanceOf**: Data Instances are instances of specific Data Models (functional property)
- **hasException**: Invalid data instances contain documented exceptions explaining validation failures

## Exception Handling Framework

S3Model includes a sophisticated **Exception** system that allows data to be:
- **Structurally conformant** to a Data Model but contain invalid values
- **Preserved with context** through documented exceptions rather than being discarded
- **Processed intelligently** by systems that understand the exception context

## Data Types and Standards

The ontology incorporates XML Schema datatypes including:
- Standard types (duration, dates, etc.)
- Specialized temporal types (gDay, gMonth, gMonthDay, gYear, gYearMonth)

## Purpose and Applications

S3Model is designed for domains requiring:

1. **Rigorous Data Modeling**: Systematic approach to defining data structures with multiple constraint layers
2. **Data Interoperability**: Common framework for data exchange between systems
3. **Robust Validation**: Multi-level validation with intelligent exception handling
4. **Model Reusability**: Components can be reused and recombined across different domain models
5. **Semantic Clarity**: Formal ontological definitions ensure clear understanding of model components

## Key Design Principles

- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear distinction between abstract models, constraints, and instances
- **Constraint-Based Design**: Multiple layers of increasingly specific constraints
- **Exception-Aware Validation**: Recognizes that real-world data may not always perfectly conform to models
- **Semantic Formalization**: Uses OWL to provide precise, machine-readable definitions
- **Reusability**: Components designed for reuse across multiple domain applications

The S3Model ontology represents a mature framework for creating robust, semantically-rich data models that can handle the complexities of real-world data while maintaining structural integrity and enabling system interoperability.
