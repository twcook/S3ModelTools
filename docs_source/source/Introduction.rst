S3Model Tools Introduction
==========================

S3Model Tools is a suite of applications that allow for the building of S3Model components and combine those components into complete data models. 

New users of S3Model should be familiar with the `S3Model User Guide <https://s3model.com/userguide/docs/index.html>`_ as well as the `S3Model Specifications <https://s3model.com/specifications/docs/index.html>`_.

- The **CSV Modeler** application allows importing of a CSV file and creating a complete data model with semantics and validation for the imported file. This can be used in a pipeline where CSV files are regularly generated and should adhere to a well-defined structure with consistent semantics.    

- The **Components** application allows for the creation of domain concepts as `Model Components <https://s3model.com/specifications/docs/glossary.html#model-component-mc>`_ that can be used across multiple data models. This application is designed to be easy to use by domain experts that understand the constraints and semantics of certain concepts. 

- The **Form Modeler** application allows for assembly of Model Components into a data model for a complete data entry form or similar use to define a complete model. 

- The **IoT Modeler** application allows for easy modeling of streaming data such as Internet of Things (IoT) devices output. The model can be used to validate data in a pipline with option of generating output data in other formats for consumption in post processing applications. For example; putting the data into knowledge graph applications with complete semantics.
