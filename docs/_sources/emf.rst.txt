==================
Graphical Modeling
==================

**IN DEVELOPMENT**

The `Eclipse Modeling Framework <https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-modeling-tools/neonr>`_ can be used to create graphical models from your generated schemas.


.. _emf:

Ecore Model Generation
----------------------

*Need a solution as to why the DM does not import the RM.*

Find out what happened to the XML Catalog entry.

Possibly import the RM then the DMs? Might need to fix the namespaces when you do this.

1. New -> Project...
2. Eclipse Modeling Framework -> EMF Project
3. Model Importers: XML Schema
4. Model URIs: [Select xsd-File]

**OR**

From the commandline (untried):

eclipse –console –noExit –noSplash -data *xsd dir location* -application org.eclipse.xsd.ecore.importer.XSD2GenModel

It generates .ecore and .genmodel for your set of XSDs.

**OR**

Adapt from this old tutorial:

.. _codegen:

Code Generators
===============

From your Ecore models, you can generate source code for many languages.

The canonical data model for each concept is always your S3Model Tools generated Schema with the embedded semantics.
