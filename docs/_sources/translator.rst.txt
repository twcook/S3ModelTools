Purpose
=======

The Translator tool is your entry point into the model-driven, low-code world of information
management. Effectively, it allows you to create *computable* metadata for your datasets.
It generates RDF for the model and the data as well as XML or JSON data if desired. The consistency in structured data reduces
software source code by up to 80% through the ability to reuse code across all models.

The open source tool `S3Model Translator <https://datainsights.tech/S3ModelTranslator>`_ allows you to transition existing datasets into the linked data, sharable model eco-system. However, it does not allow you to reuse components across data models in the way that the S3Model Tools Translator tool does.

The *Translator* is the next step towards the evolution to **S3Model** information management.
It provides an analysis and the creation of *reusable* eXtended Datatypes of existing CSV datasets so that you are
genuinely bringing existing data into the *S3Model Universe*. This process provides for fine-grained model definitions
that give enterprises a flexible, modular approach to becoming operationally *S3Model*. See :ref:`S3Model`


The Process
===========

- The primary process is first to define a Data Model Definition and import a CSV file.

- Next, select the DMD and select Process CSV from the menu.

- That step creates an eXtended Datatype for each column in the CSV.

- You now need to edit each of the eXtended Datatypes so that the information is as complete as possible.

- Once the eXtended Datatypes are complete, go back to the DMD, select it and then 'Generate a Data Model'.

- Now, these eXtended Datatypes are available for you to use as you begin the *model-backed* approach to your information management.

See our :ref:`training` offerings fo gain a firm foundation in using the tools.
