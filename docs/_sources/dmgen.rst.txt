Model Generator
===============

Purpose
=======

To provide domain experts with the ability to describe the full set of constraint parameters and semantics for a particular data set. 
Using this information the generator creates a constraint model, semantics expressed in RDF, an example data instance file in both XML and JSON 
serializations. 

An additional component is being added (Q3 - 2018) to the generator that creates 
a `progressive web app <https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/>`_ for each model. 
These apps are based on `web components <https://www.webcomponents.org/introduction>`_ and primarily reuse components from 
Google's `Polymer Project <https://www.polymer-project.org/>`_. The generated apps contain all of the constraints defined by the 
model and are easily customizable for a specific implementation.
